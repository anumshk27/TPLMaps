TPL Maps, a product of TPL Trakker Ltd. is Pakistanâ€™s first indigenous digital mapping solution. TPL Maps has been created using state of the art technology that will not only provide real time intelligent routing but also give users access to live traffic updates, turn-by-turn navigation and smart search options.

## Getting Started
Before you can begin working with TPL Maps on iOS, you need to download the TPL Maps SDK for iOS.
The TPLMap SDK for iOS is available as a CocoaPods pod. CocoaPods is an open source dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

If you don't already have the CocoaPods tool, install it on macOS by running the following command from the terminal. For details, see the [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

> sudo gem install cocoapods

Create a Podfile for the TPLMaps SDK for iOS and use it to install the API and its dependencies:

1. If you don't have an Xcode project yet, create one now and save it to your local machine. (If you're new to iOS development, create a Single View Application.)

2. Create a file named Podfile in your project directory. This file defines your project's dependencies. 

3. Edit the Podfile and add your dependencies. Here is an example which includes the dependencies you need for the TPLMaps SDK for iOS:
