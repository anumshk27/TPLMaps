TPL Maps, a product of TPL Trakker Ltd. is Pakistanâ€™s first indigenous digital mapping solution. TPL Maps has been created using state of the art technology that will not only provide real time intelligent routing but also give users access to live traffic updates, turn-by-turn navigation and smart search options.

## Getting Started
Before you can begin working with TPL Maps on iOS, you need to download the TPL Maps SDK for iOS.
The TPLMap SDK for iOS is available as a CocoaPods pod. CocoaPods is an open source dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

If you don't already have the CocoaPods tool, install it on macOS by running the following command from the terminal. For details, see the [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

> sudo gem install cocoapods

Create a Podfile for the Google Maps SDK for iOS and use it to install the API and its dependencies:

1. Get current/continious/frequent location and get current geocode/address with simple API call.
